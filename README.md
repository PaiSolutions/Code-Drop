## OSD Cloud Cleanup 
Clean up the leftover folder from a OSD Cloud Windows image build. This code can be run from [Intune/Scripts](./posts/osdCloud-Cleanup.md).

## Outlook Signature 
This is a code in the works, using MSGraph the script will pull down your AzureAD User details and put them into a Outlook Desktop Signature Template.
I would like to get the final version working with the teamplates stored on a storage blob and create a Azure Function linked to KeyVault. [Read more here](./posts/outlook-Signatures.md).
